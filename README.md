# NBodySimulationExperiment
A C++ experiment to create a simple n-body simulation

Project Limitations:
* The author (me) is not a physicist/astronomer. The algorithms reflect the current state of my research and understanding of the subject matter.
* Simulation does not account for relativity (thus black holes will simulate incorrectly)
* Simulation does not account for light-speed travel of gravity
* Simulation assumes gravity as originating only from a single point (center of mass). Does not account for distribution of mass
* Simulation does not account for drag, such as the dampening affects of a body passing through a gas or dust field.
* Collision detection is not yet implemented
* Does not support diffuse bodies (such as nebular clouds, etc)
